#Project 3, Part 2

Project Members: Ailish Skinner, Stephen Lasko

<p>
Assumptions we made in our code: We have a tracker and logger classes that are different than the interface we use when printing to the console. This is called Logger
</br>Console instead. Additionally, another liberty that we took was for our strategy design, we used both an Abstract class and an interface in our implementation. 
This was not neccessary, however, it works.

<p>
Our Strategys are implemented in multiple files: 
</br>
Strategy: TuneContext, TuneStrategy, AbstractTuneStrategy, Haphazard, Manual, Electronic 
</br>
Observer: 
</br>
Decorator:
