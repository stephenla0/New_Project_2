#Project 3, Part 2

Project Members: Ailish Skinner, Stephen Lasko
Java Version: Open JK 17

Our Strategys are implemented in multiple files: 

Strategy: TuneContext, TuneStrategy, AbstractTuneStrategy, Haphazard, Manual, Electronic
Observer: 
Decorator: 
<p>
Assumptions we made in our code: We have a tracker and logger classes that are different than the interface we use when printing to the console. This is called Logger
</br>Console instead. Additionally, another liberty that we took was for our strategy design, we used both an Abstract class and an interface in our implementation. 
This was not neccessary, however, it works.
