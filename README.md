#Project 3, Part 2

Project Members: Ailish Skinner, Stephen Lasko
Java Version: Open JK 17

<p>This project used sample code provided from project 2 and the strategy design</p>

<p>
Assumptions we made in our code: We have a tracker and logger classes that are different than the interface we were using when printing to the console. This interface was called Logger, 
but is now called ConsoleLogger instead.
</p>


<p>
Our patterns are created in multiple files: 
<br>
Strategy: TuneContext.java, TuneStrategy.java, Haphazard.java, Manual.java, Electronic.java 
<br>
Observer: ClerkObserver.java, Tracker.java, TrackerDataStructure.java, Logger.java
<br>
Decorator: DecoratoratingItem.java
</p>
